   <h1 id="idp1954912">ACIS: Security</h1>

<p>ACIS is a web-application. It is designed to be run on a public 
network, accessible by folks around the world. As such, it is 
exposed to a large number of risks and dangers.</p>

<p>I'll briefly describe how we go about them.</p>

<p>First, some facts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The user passwords are never stored or written or sent out in 
their clear-text form. (Hacker break-in, if happens, would not 
reveal the user passwords.)</p></li>
<li><p>The persistent login is cookie-based, and implemented with secure 
random tokens, that are independent of passwords, unique and hard 
to guess.</p></li>
<li><p>If you forget your password, you can reset it, by requesting a 
reset link. The reset link is also independent of the password,
unique and hard to guess. Reset links expire after 12 hours and 
a used reset link cannot be reused. (Reset feature makes account 
stealing possible, but mass account stealling is unlikely.)</p></li>
<li><p>There is no way a normal-privilege user may gain high-privilege 
admin access rights without first having write-access to the 
filesystem (specifically, the userdata files).</p></li>
<li><p>The session identifiers are long and random. (Session hi-jacking 
is not likely.) </p></li>
<li><p>System is protected from SQL-injection by using 
parameterized SQL queries (bind variables).</p></li>
<li><p>All HTML pages are generated via XSLT. No cross-site scripting is 
likely to happen, since all of the user-supplied data goes through
the strict XML escaping during XSLT processing.</p></li>
</ol>
