   <h2 id="idp1970448">Separate components</h2>

<p>ACIS is not a monolithic program.  It is a large collection of modules,
scripts, configuration files and templates.  And there are several
components which are closely related to ACIS and are required to use
it.  But these components may be used without ACIS, completely
independently.  Therefore their source code is managed and packaged
separately.</p>

<p>The central repository for ACIS is the account
<code>aacis@acis.openlib.org</code>. There, we have four directories,
which correspond to four projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>~/dev/ReDIF-perl</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>~/dev/AMF-perl</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>~/dev/RePEc-Index</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>~/dev/acis</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each project contains a separate source tree, managed with <a href="http://darcs.net">Darcs</a> revision control system.</p>


   <h2 id="idp1976704">Darcs</h2>

<p>Darcs is an easy-to-use system.  It currently lacks some nice-to-have
features, if compared to SVN or CVS.  It's core advantage is that it
supports a purely distributed development.</p>

<p>These component projects and main ACIS source code may be developed
right in aacis@acis.openlib.org. But it is better to open your own
aacis account on your machine, let us refer to the as mybox
here. After a change is done, you need to submit it to the
repository. The repository is where the source code revisions are
stored. This lives on the account <code>aacis</code>
at the host <code>acis.openlib.org</code>.</p>

<p>You will have to study the userguide of Darcs, http://darcs.net/ but
you don't have to do it now.</p>


   <h2 id="idp1979648">Working on a local working copy of a project</h2>

<p>First install Darcs on your machine.  Set up your local environment
DARCS_EMAIL to your email address. Set the environment
DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_8BIT to <code>1</code>. Then get a local copy
of a project <em>project</em>.</p>

<p><code>aacis@mybox:~ darcs get --set-scripts-executable aacis@acis.openlib.org:dev/</code><em>project</em></p>

<p>This would make you a local directory <em>project</em> in your current
directory, where <em>project</em> would be "acis", "ReDIF-perl"and so
on. Your local copy of a project's source code is called a working
copy.</p>


   <h2 id="idp1999968">Syncing your local changes with the central repository</h2>



<p>When starting a change:</p>

<p><code>aacis@mybox:~/dev/</code><em>project</em><code>$ darcs pull -a</code></p>

<p>After doing a change:</p>

<p><code>aacis@mybox:~/dev/</code><em>project</em><code>$ darcs push</code></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><code>aacis@mybox:~/dev/</code><em>project</em><code>$ darcs push -a</code></p>

<p>If you create a new module, script or some other file, you may want to
do two things, add it to the darcs repository. </p>

<p><code>aacis@mybox:~/dev/</code><em>project</em><code>$ darcs add</code> <em>file_to_add</em></p>

<p>where <em>file_to_add is the file to add. Then add _file_to_add</em>
to the <code>MANIFEST</code> file.</p>




   <h2 id="idp2008880">Manifest file</h2>

<p>There is a MANIFEST file in each of the project directories.  It lists
all files to be packaged in a release of the project. A useful command
is</p>

<p><code>aacis@mybox:~/dev/</code><em>project</em><code>$ make manifest</code></p>



<p>See also: MANIFEST.SKIP, google for "MANIFEST.SKIP file" or look it up
in the Perl camel book.</p>


   <h2 id="idp2011792">Basic code editing procedure with Darcs</h2>

<p>For example, let's imagine I had to make a change to the ReDIF-perl
project.  Here are the first steps of the procedure:</p>

<p><code>aacis@mybox:~$ cd dev/ReDIF-perl</code></p>

<p><code>aacis@mybox:~/dev/ReDIF-perl$ emacs lib/ReDIF/Parser.pm</code></p>

<p>for example. Then you may want to review the changes that you have
made to the code.  Darcs would show it to you in a format similar to
diff:</p>

<p><code>aacis@mybox:~/dev/ReDIF-perl$ darcs whatsnew</code></p>

<p>Then you may want to make sure the change didn't break any tests:</p>

<p><code>aacis@mybox:~/dev/ReDIF-perl$ make tests</code></p>

<p>Then let's assume the tests passed fine and you want to submit 
your change:</p>

<p><code>aacis@mybox:~/dev/ReDIF-perl$ darcs record -am "an improvement to the parsing algorithm"</code></p>

<p>The text in quotes is the name of your patch.  It should briefly
explain the substance of the change, or at least it's character.</p>


   <h2 id="idp2017472">Releasing a packaged version</h2>

<p>If <code>darcs record</code> worked fine and didn't complain, you may now
want to release a new version package to the public. You have to do
this at the central repository. Here we use the example of
ReDIF-perl. You do the following.</p>

<p><code>aacis@acis:~/dev/ReDIF-perl$ perl release.pl</code></p>

<p>That should make a new version number for you and pack a distribution.
The version number would be generated automatically, by incrementing
the previous one by one.  If it was 0.4 the new version would be 0.5;
if it was 4.44.4 then the new one would be 4.44.5.  The current
version number is stored in the <code>Makefile.PL</code> file.  See the
<code>release.pl</code> file for details.</p>

<p>The release file is generated in the current directory and its full
name is printed on the standard output.  You may grab it and upload to
somewhere for other people to use. For example, ReDIF-perl releases go
to <code>http://all.repec.org/ReDIF-perl/</code>.</p>

<p>This is the most basic development scenario for these three auxilary
projects.  For ACIS itself the darcs part is the same, but it has a
separate package building script.</p>

<p>If the <code>release.pl</code> script fails</p>

<p><code>aacis@acis:~/dev/ReDIF-perl$ MAKEMAKEFILE=1; perl Makefile.PL</code></p>

<p><code>aacis@acis:~/dev/ReDIF-perl$ perl release.pl</code></p>




   <h2 id="idp2024896">Building an ACIS package</h2>

<p>There are two ways the build an ACIS package. If you just want to
package acis as such, you can do</p>

<p><code>aacis@acis:~/dev/acis$ perl build/dist.pl [</code><em>version</em><code>]</code></p>

<p>where <em>version</em> is the version number. Then you release ReDIF-perl,
AMF-perl and RePEc-Index from their separate directories. An ACIS
distribution may include these components as well. It will have them
in an <code>extra/</code> subdirectory. Such a full distribution is built
using</p>

<p><code>aacis@acis:~/dev/acis$ perl build/dist.pl -f [</code><em>version</em><code>]</code></p>

<p>where <em>version</em> is the version number.</p>
