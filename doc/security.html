   <h1 id="idp1952416">ACIS: Security</h1>

<p>ACIS is a web-application. It is designed to be run on a public 
network, accessible by folks around the world. As such, it is 
exposed to a large number of risks and dangers.</p>

<p>I'll briefly describe how we go about them.</p>


   <h2 id="idp1953808">Basic facts</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The user passwords are never stored or written or sent out in 
their clear-text form. Instead, they are salted and cryptographically 
hashed before storing. The salt is random and long (32 bytes) and 
is never re-used. Hash function used is SHA-256.</p>

<p>(Hacker break-in, if happens, would not reveal and 
compromize the user passwords.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The persistent login is cookie-based, and implemented with secure 
random tokens, that are independent of passwords, unique and hard 
to guess (32 random bytes).</p></li>
<li>
<p>If a user forgets his password, he or she can reset it by requesting a 
reset link email. The reset link is also independent of the password,
unique and hard to guess. Reset links expire after 12 hours and 
a once-used reset link cannot be re-used again. </p>

<p>(Reset feature makes account theft possible, if an attacker has access to 
the victim's incomming email, but mass account theft is unlikely.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is no way a normal-privilege user may gain high-privilege 
admin access rights without first having write-access to the 
filesystem (specifically, to the userdata files).</p></li>
<li><p>The session identifiers are long and random â€” 32 bytes. (Session 
hi-jacking is not likely.) </p></li>
<li><p>System is protected from SQL-injection by using 
parameterized SQL queries (bind variables).</p></li>
<li><p>All HTML pages are generated via XSLT. No cross-site scripting is 
likely to happen, since all of the user-supplied data goes through
the strict XML escaping during XSLT processing.</p></li>
</ol>


   <h2 id="idp1960592">Brief source code guide</h2>

<p>The password hashing- and password checking-related code is in 
<code class="c BROKEN">lib/ACIS/Web/UserPassword.pm</code>.</p>

<p>The password reset feature-related code is in 
<code class="c BROKEN">lib/ACIS/Web/PasswordReset.pm</code>.</p>

<p>Random data is generated using the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Bytes%3A%3ARandom%3A%3ASecure&amp;mode=module">Bytes::Random::Secure</a> module.</p>

<p>SHA-256 is done by the 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Digest%3A%3ASHA&amp;mode=module">Digest::SHA</a> module.</p>
