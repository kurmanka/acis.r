   <h2 id="idp348656">Introduction &amp; overview</h2>

<p>Automatic Profile Update is a subsystem of ACIS, which performs a
number of operations on user profiles automatically.  It serves several
purposes, but the primary one is to make maintaining a profile in ACIS
less of a chore for the user.</p>

<p>The metadata dataset of a running ACIS service is expected to be
dynamic, with new items appearing and some old items going out (for a
number of possible reasons, even if undesired).  So one specific thing
APU does is finding new documents in the documents database, which a
registered person might have written.  If there is a highly probable
match (e.g. exact name match), APU would automatically add the document
to the person's research profile.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if a document was claimed by the user, but has gone
out of the document database, APU would clean it out of the person's
profile.  (A special grace period would be observed to allow short-term
database fluctuations, when items disappear for a while and then appear
back.)</p>

<p>When APU does a search for a personal profile, and either adds
something to the profile, or finds some items for consideration, it
would send an email to the user, notifying her about the stuff found or
changes done.</p>

<p>And yet another thing APU does is related to the <a href="citations.html">citation profile</a>.  After looking at the
person's research profile, and doing a research items search, APU also
looks for new citations for the research profile items.  And if there
are any, it would either automatically identify them to RP items or
store them in a database for the user's consideration.  Similarly, if
something interesting was found, it would email the user in charge of
the profile about it.</p>

<p>So at this time APU performs three functions for personal profiles:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>maintains them in sync with the primary metadata (cleans gone and updates
changed document records and citations).</p></li>
<li><p>runs automatic research searches</p></li>
<li><p>runs automatic citations searches</p></li>
</ul>


   <h2 id="idp356400">Some older terms</h2>

<dl>
<dt id="ARPU" C="ARPU"><code class="C">ARPU</code></dt>
<dd>Automatic Research Profile Update.  It used
to be a separate feature, but now -- a part of APU.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="binapu" C="bin/apu">The <code class="C">bin/apu</code> script</h2>

<p>APU is done for users while they are not logged in and not interacting
with the service.  So it is run separately from the main web
application interface.  All the APU-related functions are available via
the <a class="a" href="apu.html#binapu">bin/apu</a> script.  </p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/apu [options] [&lt;number&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>Run <abbr title="Automatic Profile Update">APU</abbr> processing for
the next personal record on the queue.  </p>

<p>If a number &lt;number&gt; is given, the APU is done for that many
items in the APU queue.  By default it is done for just one record.</p>

<p>The command won't produce any output on successful execution, but would
write its main steps to a log file <code class="f BROKEN">autoprofileupdate.log</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/apu [options] queue &lt;identifier&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Put the record &lt;identifier&gt; onto the APU queue.
&lt;identifier&gt; may be a short-id, an id, or a user account email
address.</p>

<p>The command won't produce any output on success.</p>

<p>The possible options are:</p>

<dl>
<dt>-\-debug</dt>

<dd>Enable printing debugging output to stdout, of all the process.
The debuggings are pretty verbose, for a large profile it may print
hundreds of screenfuls.</dd>

<dt>-\-interactive</dt>
<dt>-\-inter</dt>

<dd>Duplicate the <code class="f BROKEN">autoprofileupdate.log</code> log messages on the
standard output.  Would give you a general idea of what is going
on while APU is running.</dd>

<dt>-\-failed</dt>

<dd>Try again to execute APU for the previously failed items in the APU
queue, if there are any.</dd>

<dt>-\-noauto</dt>

<dd>Do not automatically clear and re-populate the queue table, if the
end of the queue is reached.</dd>

</dl>


   <h2 id="idp370416">How to run bin/apu?</h2>

<p>Run it at low-load periods or regularly as a cron-job.</p>

<p>Frequency of the APU runs and the <code>number</code> argument you use is
important.  Make it high enough to cover all the users.  </p>

<p>For example, if you have roughly 300 personal records, it will be more
than enough to run "<code>bin/apu 4</code>" three times a day.  It will go
through 12 records a day, about 360 per month.</p>

<p>In case you run it too often, it will start skipping queued items.  The
script will skip a record, if APU was already done for it recently.
See <a class="c" href="citations.html#minimum-apu-period-days">minimum-apu-period-days</a> configuration parameter.</p>


   <h2 id="idp374144">Configuration parameters</h2>

<p>These are the APU-related ACIS configuration parameters (to be used in
the the <a class="a" href="conf.html#mainconf">main.conf</a> configuration file):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a class="c" href="citations.html#minimum-apu-period-days">minimum-apu-period-days</a> </li>
<li><a class="c" href="citations.html#echo-apu-mails">echo-apu-mails</a></li>

</ul>


   <h2 id="idp379248">Technical: Queue management</h2>

<p>APU stores it's queue in the apu_queue table.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<summary>The apu_queue table:</summary>
<tr>
<th>field</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>what</td>
<td>record id</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>position</td>
<td>queue item number</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>filed</td>
<td>date &amp; time when it was put onto the
queue</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>class</td>
<td>should this item be treated with a
priority?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>notes</td>
<td>any messages during APU execution</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>worked</td>
<td>date &amp; time when it was executed</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It initially puts every known personal record onto the queue.  As APU
processing is executed for a record, the queue item status is changed
from empty string to "OK" or "FAIL" in the queue table.  Normally APU
runs on empty-status queue items.</p>

<p>Then when it reaches the end of the queue, it
deletes the table content and starts over again.  This usually happens
automatically.</p>
