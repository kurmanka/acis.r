   <h2 id="id2250210">Introduction</h2>

<p>ACIS is a pretty complicated application.  It both gives a
web interface to users and it produces web-accessible
objects.  For all this to work, it needs to know how to
reference itself and where to create other objects and how
to reference them.</p>

<p>If you are making a real-world public ACIS-based service,
you'll want ACIS to be available via a short URL and you'll
want it to produce short and nice URLs.  Then you'll need to
adapt Apache configuration.  Particular adaptation depends
on your choices for the ACIS configuration parameters.  In
most simple case you don't need to do that, but then your
URLs will be a bit messy.</p>

<p>Exact reasons to touch Apache configuration:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You may want ACIS to sit at the root address of a
website.  E.g. <code>http://web.site.org/</code> versus
<code>http://web.site.org/cgi-bin/acis.pl</code> .  See
configuration parameter <a class="c" href="conf.html#base-url">base-url</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You may want ACIS to generate short and clean URLs for
the users' profile pages.  Short and clean would be
something like <code>http://web.site.org/pro/pcl2/</code>,
long and dirty would be like
<code>http://web.site.org/pro/p/c/l/2/</code> or even worse.
See configuration options
<a class="c" href="conf.html#compact-redirected-profile-urls">compact-redirected-profile-urls</a> and
<a class="c" href="conf.html#profile-pages-dir">profile-pages-dir</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You may want to have the same URL value as your
<a class="c" href="conf.html#static-base-url">static-base-url</a> and your <a class="c" href="conf.html#base-url">base-url</a>.  Which
means simply shorter and nicier URLs.</p></li>
</ol>


   <h2 id="id2250292">What to do</h2>

<p>Here are the instructions for Apache 1.3+.  If you want ACIS
to work with Apache 2, there is <a href="apache-conf.html#apache2">a little
difference</a>.</p>

<p>OK, let's say you have <code>web.site.org</code> website and
want to run ACIS on it and you have default settings for
most parameters.</p>

<p id="acis-site-top">A normal CGI script has address
of something like, <code>.../cgi-bin/script.pl</code>, but you
want your users to access ACIS through the shortest, niciest
<code>http://web.site.org/</code> address.  Then we have to do
the following.</p>

<p>First, we enable mod_rewrite in our &lt;VirtualHost&gt; section:</p>

<pre><code>  RewriteEngine on
</code></pre>

<p>Second, we rewrite all incomming requests so that Apache
transfers them all to ACIS.  Let's assume the actual ACIS
CGI script is at
<code>http://web.site.org/cgi-bin/acis.pl</code> address.  Add
this:</p>

<pre><code>  RewriteRule ^(/.*)$ /cgi-bin/acis.pl$1 [L,T=application/x-httpd-cgi]
</code></pre>

<p>Let us call this line "the terminal rule line"; although it
is the first rule we introduce, it actually always must be
the last one of all rewrite rules used.  This rule means:
pass <em>all</em> requests for the website to ACIS.</p>

<p>But ACIS includes and produces some static files, which also
have to be web-accessible.  Personal profile pages -- most
important of all.  We need to configure Apache to serve
those requests by itself, without involving ACIS.  One of
the ways to do that is to add</p>

<pre><code>  RewriteRule ^/static/ - [L]
</code></pre>

<p>before the previous RewriteRule.  So together that may look
like this:</p>

<pre><code>  RewriteEngine on
  # static files:
  RewriteRule ^/static/ - [L]
  # terminal rule:
  RewriteRule ^(/.*)$ /cgi-bin/acis.pl$1 [L,T=application/x-httpd-cgi]
</code></pre>

<p>Then Apache will pass to <code>/cgi-bin/acis.pl</code> all
requests, but those starting with <code>/static/</code>.  So you
can set <a class="c" href="conf.html#static-base-url">static-base-url</a> to
<code>http://web.site.org/static</code> and
<a class="c" href="conf.html#static-base-dir">static-base-dir</a> to a corresponding directory name.</p>

<p>The personal profile URLs will then have form of
<code>http://web.site.org/static/profile/p/s/i/d/1/</code>,
which is not very nice, but if its OK for you, let it be so.
In case you don't like that, read on.</p>


   <h3 id="id2250426">Making personal profile URLs shorter</h3>

<p>First thing we could do is remove <code>static/</code> part.
For that we replace the respective RewriteRule with several
others.  </p>

<pre><code>  RewriteEngine on

  # static files:
  RewriteRule ^/style/   - [L]
  RewriteRule ^/script/  - [L]
  RewriteRule ^/profile/ - [L]

  # terminal rule:
  RewriteRule ^(/.*)$ /cgi-bin/acis.pl$1 [L,T=application/x-httpd-cgi]
</code></pre>

<p>This will make requests for stylesheets, javascript files
and for profile pages served directly by Apache, and
everything else will be taken by ACIS.  Now we can set
<a class="c" href="conf.html#static-base-url">static-base-url</a> to <code>http://web.site.org</code> and
<a class="c" href="conf.html#static-base-dir">static-base-dir</a> to its apporpriate docroot,
e.g. <code>/home/user/public_html</code>.  </p>

<p id="redirect-profile-urls">Second thing we could
do to make personal profile URLs human friendly is eliminate
the slash characters in <code>p/s/i/d/1</code> part.  Here comes
the next set of rewrite rules:</p>

<pre><code>  RewriteRule ^/profile/p([a-z][a-z0-9]+[0-9])(/(.*))?$ /P/$1/$3
  RewriteRule ^/P/(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)/(.*) /profile/p/$1/$2/$3/$4/$5/$6 [L]
  RewriteRule ^/P/(.)(.)(.)(.)/(.*)    /profile/p/$1/$2/$3/$4/$5    [L]
  RewriteRule ^/P/(.)(.)(.)/(.*)       /profile/p/$1/$2/$3/$4       [L]
</code></pre>

<p>If placed before our static files rules in Apache conf, it
will make requests like <code>/profile/psid1/</code> map to
actual files as if it was a request for
<code>/profile/p/s/i/d/1/</code>.  Now to let ACIS know we did
that, we set <a class="c" href="conf.html#compact-redirected-profile-urls">compact-redirected-profile-urls</a> to a
true value.</p>

<p>Now we have a reasonably good setup: the URLs are clean of
cruft.  To summarize we have the foolowing in our Apache
conf &lt;VirtualHost&gt; section:</p>

<pre><code>  RewriteEngine on

  # compact-redirected unique part of personal profile URLs
  RewriteRule ^/profile/p([a-z][a-z0-9]+[0-9])(/(.*))?$ /P/$1/$3
  RewriteRule ^/P/(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)/(.*) /profile/p/$1/$2/$3/$4/$5/$6 [L]
  RewriteRule ^/P/(.)(.)(.)(.)/(.*)    /profile/p/$1/$2/$3/$4/$5    [L]
  RewriteRule ^/P/(.)(.)(.)/(.*)       /profile/p/$1/$2/$3/$4       [L]

  # static files:
  RewriteRule ^/style/   - [L]
  RewriteRule ^/script/  - [L]
  RewriteRule ^/profile/ - [L]

  # terminal rule:
  RewriteRule ^(/.*)$ /cgi-bin/acis.pl$1 [L,T=application/x-httpd-cgi]
</code></pre>

<p>And we have something like the following in our
<a class="c" href="conf.html#mainconf">main.conf</a>:</p>

<pre><code>  base-url        = http://web.site.org
  base-cgi-script-filename = /var/apache/htdoc/user-cgi-bin/acis.pl
  home-url        = http://web.site.org/
  static-base-url = http://web.site.org
  static-base-dir = /home/user/public_html

  +compact-redirected-profile-urls
</code></pre>


   <h3 id="id2250545">A note on suEXEC</h3>

<p>For security and common-sense considerations it makes a lot
of sense to run ACIS CGI under suexec in Apache.  This way
you avoid a lot of permissions trouble.  </p>

<p>One of the things you need to use suexec is your CGI scripts
must reside somewhere below global DocumentRoot directory.
That's why in <a class="c" href="conf.html#mainconf">main.conf</a> snippet above the
<a class="c" href="conf.html#base-cgi-script-filename">base-cgi-script-filename</a> param points to a file in
<code>/var/apache/htdoc/user-cgi-bin/</code> (assuming that the
global DocumentRoot is <code>/var/apache/htdoc</code>).  To make
this directory correspond to your virtual host's
<code>/cgi-bin/</code> you use the following in apache conf
&lt;VirtualHost&gt; section:</p>

<pre><code>   ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/apache/htdoc/user-cgi-bin/
</code></pre>


   <h3 id="id2250588">Even shorter profile URLs</h3>

<p>With all the above you have a very reasonable setup.  But
there is one more little thing to know about making URLs
short and clean.</p>

<p>We could do to make personal profile URLs even shorter by
replacing <code>"/profile/"</code> part with something like
<code>"/pro/"</code>.  For that, we use <a class="c" href="conf.html#profile-pages-dir">profile-pages-dir</a>
parameter.  We set it to <code>"pro/"</code> and we rewrite the
Apache conf to read:</p>

<pre><code>  ...
  # compact-redirected unique part of personal profile URLs
  RewriteRule ^/pro/p([a-z][a-z0-9]+[0-9])(/(.*))?$ /P/$1/$3
  RewriteRule ^/P/(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)/(.*) /pro/p/$1/$2/$3/$4/$5/$6 [L]
  RewriteRule ^/P/(.)(.)(.)(.)/(.*)    /pro/p/$1/$2/$3/$4/$5    [L]
  RewriteRule ^/P/(.)(.)(.)/(.*)       /pro/p/$1/$2/$3/$4       [L]

  # static files:
  RewriteRule ^/style/   - [L]
  RewriteRule ^/script/  - [L]
  RewriteRule ^/pro/ - [L]
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>Which is a straight <code>"profile/"</code> -&gt; <code>"pro/"</code>
replacement.  Off you go.</p>


   <h3 id="id2250642">Changing configuration of a running sytem</h3>

<p>An important thing to know about personal profile URLs is
that once system generates and assigns a profile URL, is
stores it in the user's profile and uses it since.  If you
change your setup, the previously-assigned profile URLs will
still have the old format and ACIS will not rebuild them.
The only case when ACIS rebuilds a profile URL is when it
finds that it can't write the profile page file to its
place.  Then it tries to generate new URL and new file
pathname for it (using current configuration) and uses that.</p>

<p>That's why you better settle <a class="c" href="conf.html#static-base-dir">static-base-dir</a>,
<a class="c" href="conf.html#static-base-url">static-base-url</a>, <a class="c" href="conf.html#profile-pages-dir">profile-pages-dir</a> and
<a class="c" href="conf.html#compact-redirected-profile-urls">compact-redirected-profile-urls</a> configuration values
from the start.  And, of course, <a class="c" href="conf.html#base-url">base-url</a> and
<a class="c" href="conf.html#home-url">home-url</a>.</p>


   <h3 id="id2250685">Other files that might need to be served statically</h3>

<p>If you run ACIS at a website's top address, you may need or
prefer to serve some other files by Apache itself, without
involving ACIS.  For instance, you may want to create
favourites icon <code>/favicon.ico</code> for your website, or
you want to create <code>/robots.txt</code> file.  ACIS will not
serve such files and such requests will only burden the
system and clutter the logs.  You have to serve these files
with Apache.  For that you simply have to add appropriate
RewriteRules to your config, before the terminal rule line:</p>

<pre><code>  RewriteRule ^/favicon.ico   - [L]
  RewriteRule ^/robots.txt    - [L]
</code></pre>


   <h2 id="apache2">Apache 2 specific configuration</h2>

<p>Do everything as described above.</p>

<p>If you have lines</p>

<pre><code>  # terminal rule:
  RewriteRule ^(/.*)$ /cgi-bin/acis.pl$1 [L,T=application/x-httpd-cgi]
</code></pre>

<p>replace it with</p>

<pre><code>  # terminal rule:
  RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ /cgi/acis.cgi/$1  [NS,PT]
</code></pre>

<p>It worked for me.  I hope it helps you as well.</p>
