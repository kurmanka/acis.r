   <h2 id="id2248252">Intro</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/products/db.shtml">Berkeley
DB</a> is a very common industrial-strength open source
embedded database library.  It is used in a huge number of
applications and appliances.  ACIS uses Berkeley DB for its
<a href="daemon.html#ri-daemon">update daemon</a>.</p>

<p>The library is common and most Unix/Linux computers already
have it installed.</p>


   <h2 id="id2248277">The problem</h2>

<p>There is one problem with this library.  It requires special
attention in case you are really doing a production-level
installation of ACIS, not just playing with it.  The problem
is that later versions of the Berkeley library usually do
not support previous version’s database formats or at least
do not support it out of the box.  So if you had some data
in a database and then you update your system, and with this
update comes an upgrade for the library — you’ve got a
problem.</p>

<p>In case of such problem you either have to manually convert
database files to a newer format or erase your database and
recreate it.  Anyway, you’ll have to shutdown your update
daemon for a while and do manual work.  This is no big deal,
but for a good service you’d prefer not to do this.</p>

<p>That’s why I suggest that you build a private copy of the
library.  Then build and install a copy of the BerkeleyDB
perl module, linked to that particular copy of the library.
This way you’ll be independent of the system-wide upgrades
and save yourself from some headache.</p>


   <h2 id="id2248311">Installing the library</h2>

<p>Here is a little description of how I did this.  Your
configuration will be different, but the general algorithm
will be the same.  </p>

<p>At the time the latest published Berkeley DB library was
version 4.3.27 and it had three patches coming with it…</p>

<pre><code>$ cd install
$ tar xzvf ~/software/BerkeleyDB/db-4.3.27.NC.tar.gz
$ cd db-4.3.27.NC
$ patch -p0 &lt; ~/software/BerkeleyDB/patch.4.3.27.1
$ patch -p0 &lt; ~/software/BerkeleyDB/patch.4.3.27.2
$ patch -p0 &lt; ~/software/BerkeleyDB/patch.4.3.27.3
$ cd ../
$ mv db-4.3.27.NC db-4.3.27.NC.patched-1-2-3
$ cd db-4.3.27.NC.patched-1-2-3
</code></pre>

<p>(The latest version at the time of writing, on July 13, 2005
is 4.3.28 and has no patches with it, so it is a little bit
simplier.)</p>

<p>When the package was unpacked and patched appropriately, I
started the installation process per Berkeley DB
<a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/build_unix/intro.html">instructions</a>.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd build_unix
$ ../dist/configure <b>--prefix=/home/ivan/lib/bdb-4.3.27</b>
$ make
$ make install</code></pre>

<p>The special thing here is the <code>--prefix</code>
parameter that I gave to the configure script.</p>

<p>After that I had a private copy of the library installed in
<code>/home/ivan/lib/bdb-4.3.27</code> directory.  Thinking
about the future, I decided to create a link to use a
simplier pathname.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /home/ivan/lib
$ ln -s bdb-4.3.27 bdb
</code></pre>

<p>So after that I could refer to the library directory as
<code>/home/ivan/lib/bdb</code>.  And I had:</p>

<table class="files">
<tr>
<td>library utilities</td>
<td>in /home/ivan/lib/bdb/bin</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>C header files</td>
<td>in /home/ivan/lib/bdb/include</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>library files</td>
<td>in /home/ivan/lib/bdb/lib</td>
</tr>
</table>


   <h2 id="id2248433">Installing the BerkeleyDB perl module</h2>

<p>Next step was to install the perl module <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/BerkeleyDB/">BerkeleyDB</a>.</p>

<p>First I ensured that I do not have a system-wide installed
version of this module.  This is to avoid confusion and
nasty potential problems of differently compiled &amp; linked
versions of it.</p>

<p>Then, I got source package from CPAN (see link above) and
went on:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/install
$ tar xzvf ~/software/BerkeleyDB/BerkeleyDB-0.26.tar.gz
$ cd BerkeleyDB-0.26
</code></pre>

<p>This module is configured via <code>config.in</code> file.
Before you start changing it, you may want to save its
original version (although its not critical).  When I was
doing it, I simply renamed the provided file to a backup and
created a new file in its place.</p>

<pre><code>$ mv config.in config.in.orig
$ vi config.in
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve put the following lines in it:</p>

<pre><code>INCLUDE = /home/ivan/lib/bdb/include
LIB     = /home/ivan/lib/bdb/lib
DBNAME = -ldb
</code></pre>

<p>After that I went on with the standard installation
procedure:</p>

<pre><code>$ make 
$ make test
$ su
</code></pre>

<p>Entered root password and, finally…</p>

<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it.  The library and the module at this stage is
installed.  Unless something went wrong on one of the
previous stages, you are now ready to fire up the <a href="daemon.html">update daemon</a>.</p>
